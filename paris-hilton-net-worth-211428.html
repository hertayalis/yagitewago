In 2006, she created Paris Hilton Entertainment, a multi-billion-dollar company consisting of 45 branded stores throughout the Middle East and Asia selling handbags and other consumer products. As a DJ, designer, recording artist, host, actress, model and author, Hilton has built a global empire, and this year will expand her brand with new apparel and beauty launches in China and Korea.</p><p>Born in New York, Paris is a great-granddaughter of <a href=#>Conrad Hilton</a>, founder of Hilton Hotels. As a child, Paris found her passion for singing and acting along with her sister, Nicky Hilton. Once a teenager, she began her modeling career, walking in fashion week runways and securing magazine and brand campaigns. Her father, Rick Hilton, encouraged her to pursue business at a young age and by 18 she was a budding entrepreneur, building and establishing her own brand. Currently, Hilton oversees product development, design, marketing and promotion for Paris Hilton Entertainment, which includes her own lines of shoes, handbags, watches, lashes and nails, sunglasses, clothing and cosmetic collections.</p><p>Since 2004, Hilton has released 23 fragrances, grossing more than $2.5 billion. In 2011, Variety declared Paris Hilton as a "Billion Dollar Entrepreneur" in recognition of her successful business and global brand. In 2015, Hilton celebrated her 10-year anniversary in the fragrance industry and released Paris Hilton's Limited Edition Anniversary scent to commemorate and celebrate this achievement. Last summer, Hilton released "Gold Rush," followed by its male counterpart, "Gold Rush for Men." Following the international success, Hilton released "Rose Rush" this summer. Her perfumes are currently sold in 63 countries.</p><p>In 2012, Hilton was able to accomplish a lifelong dream and follow in her family's footsteps by venturing into the world of hotels and real estate. In 2013, the Paris Beach Club at The Azure opened in the Philippines. By partnering with leading real estate firm Century Properties, Hilton's Beach Club includes a string of luxury resort residences.</p><p>In 2013, Hilton signed to renowned music label Young Money Cash Money Billionaires, the label founded by impresario brothers Bryan "Birdman" Williams and Ronald "Slim" Williams and known for successful artists including Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj. YMCMB is now a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. That year, she released the hit single "Good Time", featuring Lil Wayne, which was followed by her single "Come Alive", which Hilton wrote alongside producer Mr. Beatz. Hilton released her third single "High Off My Love" the following year with an accompanying music video directed by Hannah Lux Davis. The single peaked at number one on the Billboard Dance Charts and stayed on top of the charts for five consecutive weeks.</p><p>While working on her music, Hilton landed a coveted DJ residency at Ibiza super-club Amnesia in 2013. Performing weekly throughout the summer, Hilton led a crowd of more than 10,000 club goers through an energetic music show. Due to the overwhelming success and acclaim, Hilton recently completed her fifth summer stint at Amnesia. In 2015 alone, Hilton completed more than 30 shows as a DJ. She received the "Best Female DJ of the Year" award from the prestigious NRJ Awards in France. Accepting her award from respected DJ/music artist Bob Sinclar, Hilton noted it was a hugely proud moment and a career milestone. In 2015, Hilton performed at Summerfest, the World's largest music festival in Milwaukee, where she performed in front of 50,000 concert-goers. Hilton is currently working on new music to be released soon.</p><p>Hilton is widely recognized as one of the original pioneers of reality TV after introducing the new genre of American television into the homes of millions as the co-star of "The Simple Life." The hit FOX series became a worldwide phenomenon. The show ran for more than five years from 2002 - 2007 and made Hilton a household name, leading to FOX awarding Hilton in 2009 with the prestigious award for "Innovator of Reality TV." Since then, Hilton has hosted CBS' Fashion Rocks national telecast and the CW's "World Dog Awards." She has also hosted and presented at the MTV Music Awards, MTV Video Award, Kids' Choice Awards and the iconic Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Philanthropy is an important part of Hilton's life and she regularly makes time for special visits to the Children's Hospital in LA and various orphanages and hospitals overseas. She is also passionately involved with the Starlight Children's Foundation, American Humane Association, the Nancy Davis Foundation and the Race to Erase MS, Operation Smile, Union Rescue Mission and the Breast Cancer Foundation. In 2011, the Starlight Children's Foundation honored Hilton with the "Golden Heart" for her charitable efforts for the organization and in 2012 she welcomed a sick boy from Ireland into her home to make his Starlight wish come true. The American Humane Association also acknowledged Hilton's philanthropic efforts by awarding her with their prestigious "National Humanitarian Award" in 2014.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeglr%2Bqv4yhoKWsn6N6r7HTZq6oqqSdenN9kG1pcQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stan-kirsch.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stan Kirsch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jon-bellion-wiki-biography-age-height-instagram-girlfriend-net-worth-lyrics-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Jon Bellion Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Instagram, GIrlfriend, Net Worth, Lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./76147-alan-jacksons-cute-daughters-grown-beaut-html.html>Alan Jackson's three cute little daughters are all grown up now and look like beautiful models</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./could-the-terminal-list-get-a-season-2.html>Could The Terminal List get a season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-hyperx-alloy-elite-rgb-mechanical-keyboard-review.html>Per-Key Quality Testing &amp;amp; Hands-On</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-banlaki-net-worth.html>Rbert Bnlaki Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caught-on-cam-srikanths-son-with-shanaya-kapoor.html>Srikanth's Son with Shanaya Kapoor</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt.
