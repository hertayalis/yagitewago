Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Krizz Kaliko was born Samuel William Christopher Watson. He had vitiligo, a skin ailment that causes white patches of skin on the body because the body doesn’t produce enough melanin.</p><p>Krizz experienced bullying as a result of her weight and vitiligo. At his school, he was frequently bullied by other children who would follow after him, hurl rocks at him, mock him, degrade him, and slam him.</p><p>As a youngster, Krizz was subjected to such severe bullying that he had to spend most of his days walking home from school.</p><p>The American rapper had a solid family background but few pals as a child. They all genuinely cared about him and were always there to support him. His mother taught him how to sing and assisted him in getting ready to participate in a choir, while his father served as his idol.</p><p>Krizz’s main focus was on his sister, who frequently defended herself against bullies with a knife or a gun. Krizz’s supportive family helped him discover his passion for music and his talent for singing.
