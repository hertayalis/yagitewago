Together with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/how-far-did-gary-player-drive-the-golf-ball>Gary Player</a>, they formed the “Big Three” in the 1960s and their exploits transformed the game of golf – they were big business! They were the first idols of the TV age and countless young golfers were inspired to pick up a club by their scintillating play and consummate professionalism. Both Nicklaus and Palmer enjoyed tremendous success both on and off the golf course. How did their careers compare?</p><h2 id=majors-3>Majors</h2><figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>In men’s professional golf Jack Nicklaus leads the way in Major performances. He won 18 Majors and completed the career Grand Slam three times over. Nicklaus won his first Major in 1962 at the age of just 22. Fittingly for this article, he defeated Arnold Palmer in an 18-hole playoff at Oakmont Country Club to claim the first of his four US Open titles. Jack won The Open Championship on three occasions and the PGA Championship five times. He is a six-time Masters champion, most recently in 1986. His Major-winning career spanned an incredible 24 years.</p><p>Arnold Palmer won seven Major titles over a much shorter span of time – between 1958 and 1964.

He won the US Open once, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/how-arnold-palmer-changed-the-open-even-if-he-wasnt-its-sole-saviour>The Open Championship twice</a> and The Masters on four occasions.</p><p>Nicklaus also outperformed Palmer in terms of top-10 Major finishes. Palmer recorded 38 top-10s in Majors, including his seven wins. Nicklaus managed an astonishing 73 top-10s in the Majors. Through the 1970s, Nicklaus played every Major and only finished outside of the top-10 on five occasions.</p><h2 id=amateur-golf-3>Amateur Golf</h2><figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>Jack Nicklaus was a two-time US Amateur champion and was twice a member of the US Walker Cup team.

Nicklaus’ Ryder Cup record was 17-8-3. He won 66% of the games he played in. Nicklaus was twice Ryder Cup captain, a winning one in 1983 and a losing one in 1987.</p><p>Arnold Palmer was always on the winning team in the six Ryder Cups he played in and the one in which he was non-playing captain (1975). He first played in 1961, was playing captain in 1963 and last played in 1973. His playing record was 22-8-2. He won 69% of the games he played in.</p><h2 id=awards-3>Awards</h2><figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>Jack Nicklaus has received more awards than there is space to mention them in this article.
