MILKY WAY LITE</h2><p>This candy bar was supposed to be a healthier version of its classic.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Discontinued Items">Read More on Discontinued Items</h2><p>It was launched in 1996 and was reportedly one of the first “healthier” candy bars on the market.</p><p>This was designed as a marketing tool in order to meet food standard regulations for a "lite" label.</p><p>It had 170 calories as opposed to the normal 220, plus half the fat of the usual amount.&nbsp;</p><h2>2.

WONKA BAR&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/JL-WONKABARjpg-JS805112667.jpg><p>The Wonka Bar had a few lives after first being introduced in 1976 by Chicago's Breaker Confections.</p><p>The Wonka Bar was made popular due to the 1964 novel “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.”</p><p>It was then bought by Nestle in 1988, and sold in the states until January 2010.</p><p>Back in 2005 for Tim Burton’s film adaptation, a Wonka bar was packaged with a Golden Ticket, entitling the winner to a $10,000 cash prize.</p><p>The bar, which had graham cracker pieces and milk chocolate and retailed until January 2010.</p><p>Fans are still heartbroken over the loss.</p><p>One Twitter user wrote: “I am still so devastated, that even after ten years of it being discontinued, I am still shocked that the Wonka Bar product line is no more.”</p><h2>4.
