However, her comeback performance at event is been highly criticized as many viewers and listeners believe that the musician was “lip-syncing” during her performance.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/1ecb2822-d9ec-4d05-a1a9-ccc750f0375c.1427040311><p>Performing in front of thousands of people, Carey looked stunning in a tight-fitted red gown as she sang her iconic festive song. But it seems fans immediately got to know that the singer was ‘lip-syncing’ throughout the performance when they found out that her voice sounded really similar to the recorded version of the hit 1994 track.</p><p>Fans were really unhappy with the singer’s blatant use of lip-syncing and blasted her for wasting their time. One of the fans wrote, “Respect to Mariah Carey for not even pretending not to lip sync.” Another fan wrote, “After that disastrous lip sync, it’s only fitting that Mariah Carey’s trademark attempt to become the official Queen of Christmas was rejected. Yikes.” Another listener tweeted, “So we’re just supposed to pretend like Mariah Carey is actually singing All I Want For Christmas live right now? Terrible lip sync.”<br>“Mariah Carey just did the worst lip sync job of all time.. how you ruin Christmas in November,” wrote another fan. “This Mariah Carey lip sync might go down as the worst attempt in history. I don’t think her mic was even on, her face certainly wasn’t moving,” said another listener.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Respect to Mariah Carey for not even pretending not to lip sync</p>— Andy Kalmowitz (@andy_witz) <a href=#>November 24, 2022</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>After that disastrous lip sync, it’s only fitting that Mariah Carey’s trademark attempt to become the official Queen of Christmas was rejected.
