The couple, Edward McDaniel Jr and Brenda McDaniel, was shot dead outside their home in Springfield, police said. Both McDaniels were Army physicians and Edward was an active-duty colonel. &nbsp;</p><p>On Thursday, May 27, D’Angelo Strand, 19, of Fort Washington, Maryland, and Ronnie Marshall, 20, were arrested, in connection with the <a href=# rel>killing</a> of Edward, 55, and his wife, Brenda, 63, both from <a href=# rel>Springfield</a>. "Two distinguished military veterans were gunned down in their front yard," Fairfax Police Chief Kevin Davis said at a news briefing on May 26. "(They) served our community for many, many years. And they were shot and killed in cold blood in their own front yard."</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who is Raphael Schklowsky?

Eight felony charges have been filed against the two men, according to Fairfax’s major crimes unit commander Major Ed O’Carroll. Both the suspects will face two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of the use of a firearm each, in the commission of a felony.</p><p>“As of this moment, we have not located the firearm, but we have a lot of work to do. I mentioned the vehicle that’s now in our possession. We got a lot of things to follow up on. We want that firearm… This case does not close with these two arrests and these multiple charges. In some aspects, it’s just beginning,” O’Carroll said. O’Carroll revealed that the police received a tip on Thursday, May 27, about the whereabouts of a vehicle connected to the case after a local resident called in. At that time, they said they took an unnamed person of interest into custody. "Thanks to the community, we got our offenders," O'Carroll said. He also credited US Marshals for assisting them during the arrests.&nbsp;</p><p>Chief Davis said on Thursday, May 27, that the police are not sure about the motive behind the murders but believe it had to do with a dispute stemming from the incident on May 24. The suspects and a relative of the victims were co-workers, according to investigators.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqp%2Bju6qxjKScmqaUp7JuucCrqqGZnKF6pXnAp56epJ9iwLW%2BwKebZpmip7K0wIyvoKufmaO2onnEna6aqpRir7OxzZ2YZqWTYrGiusieo2alpaexpr4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./141799-7-funny-anti-valentines-day-memes-for-happily-single-people-because-singles-awareness-day-doesnt-have-to.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>7 Funny Anti-Valentine's Day Memes For Happily Single People, Because Singles Awareness Day Doesn't</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-murder-in-apartment-12-victim-nona-dirksmeyers-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who are Murder in Apartment 12 victim Nona Dirksmeyers parents?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./76147-alan-jacksons-cute-daughters-grown-beaut-html.html>Alan Jackson's three cute little daughters are all grown up now and look like beautiful models</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./could-the-terminal-list-get-a-season-2.html>Could The Terminal List get a season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-hyperx-alloy-elite-rgb-mechanical-keyboard-review.html>Per-Key Quality Testing &amp;amp; Hands-On</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-banlaki-net-worth.html>Rbert Bnlaki Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caught-on-cam-srikanths-son-with-shanaya-kapoor.html>Srikanth's Son with Shanaya Kapoor</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt.
