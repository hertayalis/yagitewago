Back in 2016, Justice League executive producer Deborah Snyder had hinted that Fisher’s Cyborg would be a part of the then-in-development Flash movie.</p><p>According to <a href=#>The Wrap</a>, Fisher’s representation at Management 360 and Paradigm Agency made the following statement: “Mr Fisher is, and has been, under contract with WB Pictures since 2014. …Per the terms of that pre-negotiated contract, the option to include Mr. Fisher as the character of Victor Stone (aka Cyborg) has always rested in the hands in WB Pictures.” In 2014, a Cyborg movie <a href=#>was being planned by Warner Bros.</a>, but The Wrap reports that the film’s development ended back in 2016.</p><p>Fisher’s Justice League costar <a href=#>Jason Momoa</a> has come out in support of Fisher, posting in a recent Instagram post, “THIS SHIS HAS TO STOP AND NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT @ray8fisher AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO EXPERIENCED WHAT HAPPENED UNDER THE WATCH OF @wbpictures NEEDS PROPER INVESTIGATION.” Momoa says later in the post, “Serious stuff went down. It needs to be investigated and people need to be held accountable. #IStandWithRayFisher.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>At a San Diego Comic-Con appearance in 2017, Fisher stated, “Joss is a great guy and Zack [Snyder] picked a good person to come and clean up and finish up for him.” However, in a tweet on June 29, Fisher said, “I’d like to take a moment to forcefully retract every bit of this statement.”</p><p>On July 1, Fisher followed up this tweet with another stating, “Joss Whedon’s on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable. He was enabled, in many ways, by [former DC Entertainment president] Geoff Johns and [former Warner Bros. co-president of production] Jon Berg.”</p><p>Warner Bros. began an investigation into Fisher’s claims, but in September, Fisher criticized DC Films President Walter Hamada for siding with Johns. Warner Bros. claims that Fisher never accused anyone of “actionable conduct.” Yet in a tweet from September 14, Fisher says, “Others (including an implicated individual that called me to apologize) have already been interviewed. We will not let ANY investigator cherry-pick interviewees that best suit @wbpictures’ false narrative and scapegoating efforts. All with stories WILL be heard!”</p><p>Fisher’s frustrations with WB stem from reshoots for Justice League handled by Whedon, after the film’s original director, Zack Snyder stepped down for personal reasons. The choice to put the film in the hands of Whedon has caused many DC fans to proclaim that the Avengers directorruined the film, calling for the release of what they called the “Snyder Cut.” Eventually, HBO Max unveiled that <a href=#>they would premiere Zack Snyder’s Justice League cut</a> in four episodes in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iqka56p7XSoZyrZZGpwaKvyqxksJpencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./skylar-diggins-smith-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Skylar Diggins-Smith Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rashanda-mccants-net-worth-222812.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rashanda McCants Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./76147-alan-jacksons-cute-daughters-grown-beaut-html.html>Alan Jackson's three cute little daughters are all grown up now and look like beautiful models</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./could-the-terminal-list-get-a-season-2.html>Could The Terminal List get a season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-hyperx-alloy-elite-rgb-mechanical-keyboard-review.html>Per-Key Quality Testing &amp;amp; Hands-On</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-banlaki-net-worth.html>Rbert Bnlaki Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caught-on-cam-srikanths-son-with-shanaya-kapoor.html>Srikanth's Son with Shanaya Kapoor</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt.
