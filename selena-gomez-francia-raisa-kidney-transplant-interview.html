This morning, the pair continued to share their story on Today. In the second installment of their revealing interview, Gomez shared how she struggled to accept her fame, Raisa explained how her faith guided her through the donation and both opened up about Selena's hiatus last year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>At first, Gomez didn't want to accept the fact that she was suffering from Lupus.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'd get fevers, headaches, I'd get fatigue, but I always just kept going," she told Today's Savannah Guthrie. "I've kind of ignored it, to be honest, because it wasn't something that I really wanted to accept.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don't think I made the right decisions because I didn't accept it, and that's extremely selfish, and at the same time really just unnecessary. I'm not really proud of that." The 25-year-old added that she's "definitely the hardest person on myself."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>During her hiatus last year, she and Raisa went six months without talking.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gomez didn't only cancel her tour and log off social media when she took some time off in 2016, she also spent some time away from her closest friends, including Raisa. "I went away to a facility, I took some time off, I needed to get my mind right, be healthy, I removed myself from everyone in my life," Selena explained.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We went six months without speaking," Raisa said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Just the fact that you have people in your life that can understand where you are and not judge you for it, not make you feel bad for it..." Gomez continued.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was a huge lesson of friendship for me, and trust, because it's easy to feel offended or want to be there. It's just, they need to go through their own thing," Raisa added.</p><img alt="selena gomez francia raisa" title="selena gomez francia raisa" width=2033 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/selena-francia-2011-1505395870.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p>Raisa and Gomez</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>For Selena, it wasn't about "getting caught up" with fame, but rather struggling to accept it.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don't think I ever accepted the position I had," she said. "It was me almost feeling guilty about fame. Because people could see anyone in my position and just say, 'Wow, they've got it all figured out, they've got everything, they get to live this cool life.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added, "You're isolated, you're being looked at, you're being judged, and I'm always trying to be nice, I want to be great—that's genuinely who I am deep down, but it just seemed pointless."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The girls' strong faith helped them get through their kidney transplant together.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked where she got the courage to donate a kidney to her friend, Raisa said, "The only answer I have is God, honestly. If I didn't have my relationship with God, I don't think I would've been able to."</p><p>Selena also cited her faith. "What I believe is that it does happen for a reason. I think a huge part of my discernment and my honesty and my truth has been because I've had a relationship with God," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Even with everything she's been through, Gomez is moving forward with a positive outlook.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don't want people to think that it's a sad thing that I went through this with Francia or with anything in my life, because at the end of the day, I think all of the stuff that I went through made me and defined everything that I am right now," she said. "I think it's a really beautiful thing and I have to remind myself that. It's not a negative experience."<br></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Selena Gomez Opens Up About Her Struggle With Depression and Why She Went to Rehab" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/58cc63b8d55930653af0b5ce/thumb_1489789889.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
