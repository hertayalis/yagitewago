On June 12, 2018, Hackenberg was waived by the Raiders, and the trade with the Jets was negated. The next day, Hackenberg cleared waivers and became a free agent.</p><p>On August 12, 2018, Hackenberg signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He sat out two games before making his preseason debut on August 30 against the New York Jets. He was waived on September 1, 2018.</p><p>On September 3, 2018, Hackenberg was signed to the Cincinnati Bengals' practice squad. On November 5, 2018, Hackenberg was released from the Bengals' practice squad.</p><p>In November 2018, Hackenberg participated in the Alliance of American Football's quarterback camp. Later in the month, he was drafted by the Memphis Express in the second round of the 2019 AAF QB Draft.</p><p>Hackenberg started the Jets' 2017 training camp competing with <a href=#>Josh McCown</a> and <a href=#>Bryce Petty</a> for the starting quarterback job.</p><p>Hackenberg was beat out by Petty for the backup spot behind McCown during the preseason. Hackenberg was active as McCown's backup for the first game of the season due to Petty being injured, but moved to third string when Petty returned the next week. Hackenberg was inactive the duration of the Jets' season until McCown broke his hand week 14 at the Denver Broncos and was placed on injured reserve. Hackenberg was active the final three games as Petty's backup. He did not play a down in the 2017 season.</p><p>On January 2, 2016, Hackenberg officially declared for the 2016 NFL Draft.</p><p>The New York Jets selected Hackenberg in the second round (51st overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. On May 12, 2016, the New York Jets signed Hackenberg to a four-year, $4.66 million contract featuring a $1.6 million signing bonus.</p><p>Hackenberg made his preseason debut on August 27, 2016 during the third preseason game against the New York Giants, where he completed 6 out of 16 passes for 105 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He also played in the preseason finale against the Philadelphia Eagles on September 1, 2016, where he was 11 for 31 with 54 passing yards and an interception returned for a touchdown.</p><p>Hackenberg began the regular season as the Jets' fourth-string quarterback. He was inactive for the first 15 regular season games, and was only active in the season finale due to a decimated depth chart. Throughout the season, he remained on the bench behind starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who was benched for ineffective play, <a href=#>Geno Smith</a>, who went on season-ending injured reserve list, and <a href=#>Bryce Petty</a>, who also suffered a season-ending injury. Hackenberg did not play a down in the 2016 season.</p><p>Hackenberg committed to Penn State after being recruited by a tandem of Penn State coaches â€“ quarterbacks coach Charlie Fisher and running backs coach/recruiting coordinator <a href=#>Charles London</a>, turning down offers from Alabama, UConn, Florida, Rutgers, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Scouted as a five-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, and the No. 2 pro-style quarterback in the nation, Hackenberg was described as an accurate, drop-back passer with ample athleticism who had a high ceiling.</p><p>As a true freshman in 2013, Hackenberg was named the team's starting quarterback. In the first three games of the season, he twice earned Big Ten Conference Freshman of the Week accolades, with a 72-percent completion percentage, 851 yards, 4 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. In a game against Eastern Michigan, he set the Penn State single-game record for passing yards by a freshman with 311 (previous record of 280 held by Zack Mills). Coach Bill O'Brien commended Hackenberg's leadership of the team, noting that the team fed off his calm demeanor, in contrast to O'Brien's fiery personality. He did note that Hackenberg made some mistakes typical of younger players, but he was on the fast track to grasping O'Brien's complex offensive schemes. Hackenberg was a five-time Big Ten Freshman of the Week and was named the 2013 Big Ten Football Freshman of the Year.</p><p>Hackenberg broke ten school freshman records, and one overall Penn State record in 2013.</p><p>Hackenberg struggled in his debut with the Express, completing just 10 of 23 passes for 87 yards and an interception before being pulled in the fourth quarter as the Express were shut out by the Birmingham Iron 26â€“0. His poor performances continued over the next two games as he combined for 32 of 62 completed passes with three interceptions and no touchdowns; he was replaced by <a href=#>Zach Mettenberger</a> during the third game against the Orlando Apollos. On February 25, Express head coach <a href=#>Mike Singletary</a> announced Mettenberger would become the starting quarterback. When Mettenberger was injured on March 16, <a href=#>Brandon Silvers</a>, not Hackenberg, replaced him as the Express' quarterback. The same day, Memphis signed <a href=#>Johnny Manziel</a> to serve as Silvers' backup. The league ceased operations in April 2019.</p><p>Christian Blaize Hackenberg (born February 14, 1995) is an American football quarterback who is a free agent. He played college football at Penn State, and was drafted by the New York Jets in the second round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was also a member of the Oakland Raiders, Philadelphia Eagles, and Cincinnati Bengals, although he never actually played in an NFL game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfmLWztdKtoJqmXZ2upLfEp5meqpc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-intel-xeon-w-3175x-review-28-unlocked-cores-2999-usd.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>CPU Performance: Rendering Tests - The Intel Xeon W-3175X Review: 28 Unlocked Cores, $2999</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./actors-who-made-people-cry-on-set.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Actors Who Made People Cry On Set</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./76147-alan-jacksons-cute-daughters-grown-beaut-html.html>Alan Jackson's three cute little daughters are all grown up now and look like beautiful models</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./could-the-terminal-list-get-a-season-2.html>Could The Terminal List get a season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-hyperx-alloy-elite-rgb-mechanical-keyboard-review.html>Per-Key Quality Testing &amp;amp; Hands-On</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-banlaki-net-worth.html>Rbert Bnlaki Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caught-on-cam-srikanths-son-with-shanaya-kapoor.html>Srikanth's Son with Shanaya Kapoor</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt.
