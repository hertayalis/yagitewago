However, it’s quite common to see old bills circulate.</p><p>So, when one <a href=#>TikTok</a> user shared that a store in New Hampshire wouldn’t accept her old hundred-dollar bill, she was fuming.

On June 24, 2023, TikTok creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasey Lee (@kaseybay326)</a> shared her experience in a store where they wouldn’t accept her $100 bill.</p><p>“It's bad enough they can't tell time, address an envelope, or make change. At least they should know what all legal tender in the U.S. looks like. Imagine if I had tried to use a $2 bill or silver dollar for that matter,” the caption reads.</p><p>As the video starts, a frustrated Kasey sits in her car and tells her story.</p><p>“I just left a store here in New Hampshire and I have $142 worth of merchandise. I tried to check out and the 18-year-old — I know because she told me how old she was — behind the register refused to take my money,” Kasey says as she shows the $100 bill.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kaseybay326 href=#>@kaseybay326</a><p>it's bad enough they can't tell time, address an envelope or make change ... at least they should know what all legal tender in the US looks like - Imagine if I had tried to use a $2 bill or silver dollar for that matter <a title=dobetteramerica href=#>#dobetteramerica</a> <a title=whatareweteachingthem href=#>#whatareweteachingthem</a> <a title=old100dollarbill href=#>#old100dollarbill</a> <a title=kaseybay href=#>#kaseybay</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kasey Lee" href=#>♬ original sound - Kasey Lee</a></figure><p>“Because she said it wasn’t real,” Kasey said. “She saw the date, she saw 1990 and advised me that they didn’t make $100 bills back in 1990.”</p><p>Kasey shows the $100 bill once again and said, “I asked her to get her manager.”</p><p>Once the manager arrived, they were also aligned with the cashier.</p><p>“Her manager came over and is 26 years old.

We have to be smarter than this.</p><p>Kasey then places her finger on her head, sighed, and said, “We’re screwed.”</p><p>In a follow-up video, Kasey explained that the cashier didn’t have the counterfeit marker.

In Kasey’s comment section on TikTok, folks are not only surprised by her currency being rejected but they are also troubled that the store didn’t have any counterfeit tools to at least check that the bill was real or fake.</p><p>“They didn’t have the marker that will tell you it’s fake?!
