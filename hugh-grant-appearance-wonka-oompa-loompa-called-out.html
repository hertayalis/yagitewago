earlier film iterations were quick to share their excitement over the upcoming film, and many went wild over the Love Actually actor's appearance as the shrinked fictional character, it didn't sit right with fellow British actor <strong>George Coppen</strong>, who has dwarfism.</p><p id=enF0lyCapA data-wc=45>George, who is best known for playing Sweet Cupid in Netflix's The School for Good and Evil, in turn expressed his disappointment over the missed opportunity to cast an actor with dwarfism for the role, as was the case in the 1971 and 2005 films.</p><figure

love,"</strong> the actor told the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>BBC</a>.</p><p id=e-4Y_ZdsvmO data-wc=42>He added: "A lot of people, myself included, argue that dwarfs should be offered everyday roles in dramas and soaps, but we aren't getting offered those roles," noting: <strong>"One door is being closed but they have forgotten to open the next one."</strong></p><p id=esqw0Da6GGA

and chocolate enthusiast Willy, <strong>Peter Ostrum</strong> as main character Charlie Bucket, and various actors with dwarfism starred as the Oompa-Loompas.</p><p id=ebMUivCMI3 data-wc=35>In 2005,

will have you know that I am a perfectly respectful size for an Oompa-Loompa."</p><p id=e2678KU0JiD data-wc=18>The film also features roles from <strong>Rowan Atkinson, Sally Hawkins, Olivia Colman, Matt Lucas, Jim Carter,</strong> and others.</p><p id=eGt5e2Lzw8Q data-wc=59>A synopsis released by Warner Bros. reads: "Based on the extraordinary character at the center of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl's most iconic children's book and one of the best-selling children's books of all time, Wonka tells the wondrous story of how the world's greatest inventor, magician and chocolate-maker became the beloved Willy Wonka we know today."</p><p id=e2lFw1XzfQe data-wc=39>Back in April during an appearance at CinemaCon 2023 in Las Vegas, Timothée said of his co-star: "It was a trip [seeing High as an Oompa-Loompa]. Hugh is one of our greats…it was a dream to work with him."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcHFuZWt8qcHGoWSgqpGjwW6tz6mcmqqRo7CmedaopaSZXaS8rrzAZqOop52lrm6vwKWjnpxdpMK1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's Full Relationship Timeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./discontinued-candy-bars.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Four candy bars you'll never see again and people are so devastated</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./76147-alan-jacksons-cute-daughters-grown-beaut-html.html>Alan Jackson's three cute little daughters are all grown up now and look like beautiful models</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./could-the-terminal-list-get-a-season-2.html>Could The Terminal List get a season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-hyperx-alloy-elite-rgb-mechanical-keyboard-review.html>Per-Key Quality Testing &amp;amp; Hands-On</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-banlaki-net-worth.html>Rbert Bnlaki Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caught-on-cam-srikanths-son-with-shanaya-kapoor.html>Srikanth's Son with Shanaya Kapoor</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt.
