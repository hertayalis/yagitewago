In a format similar to that of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Love Island</a>, individuals couple up with one another rose ceremony after rose ceremony during the beloved competition series, and with an uneven number of men and women at all times, those left without a match are eliminated.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>While the entire process of Bachelor In Paradise might sound rather unconventional, some of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most beloved couples in Bachelor Nation</a> found love with one another on the shores of Sayulita, Mexico, such as Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Serena Pitt and Joe Amabile</a>, <a href=#>Mari Pepin, </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and Kenny Braasch</a>, and more.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>Now, Bachelor In Paradise season 9 has just seven men and seven women remaining, and one couple has already become boyfriend and girlfriend during their time on the show.
