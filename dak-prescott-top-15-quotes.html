I think that kind of translates onto the field. Football serves for a lot of life lessons, and so it allows me to stay humble and continue to work.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“If you’re a competitor, you want to win. That’s enough to play for, simple as that.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“If there’s one perk, it’s being the quarterback of America’s team and being able to make a difference off the field.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I want to go where I’m the difference. I want to make something out of nothing. I want to be the reason someone is great.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I’m hard on myself. I’m my biggest critic.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I grew up in Haughton, Louisiana. I go to my white grandparents’ house, and then I cross the railroad tracks and hang out with my black grandma. We have English teachers on my white side. My grandpa is a principal. And then you go to the other side, and people have been in jail.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I’ve always had high expectations of myself. I’ve never felt that there was anything I couldn’t do in this world.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“When I chose Mississippi State, of course, I dreamed about being a big-time college football player. But I’m so grateful that actually became a reality – and it became a reality in a small town.”― Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I don’t think people know how much time and effort truly goes into the game and goes into simply just scoring a touchdown. So when you get that opportunity, you should be able to be free and be relaxed from all the pressure that went into scoring that touchdown and have fun.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“A few weeks after my mom passed in November of 2013, I came back from an injury and entered the Egg Bowl in the second half against Ole Miss. I’ll never forget the feeling when I walked back out on the field. As I walked into the Egg Bowl, the crowd stood up and clapped like they were enveloping me in a giant hug.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“If somebody says I’m a leader or notices the things I try to do to be a leader, it’s the ultimate compliment.”― Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I don’t really put too much pressure on myself. The only time people feel the pressure is when they put it on themselves and listen to the outside stuff. I have great teammates and great coaches that do the right things around me that allows me to just focus on the game of football.”― Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“THE GAME OF FOOTBALL IS SOMETHING I DEARLY LOVE, AND THERE’S NOTHING ELSE I’D RATHER BE DOING.”― DAK PRESCOTT</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I am smarter because I stayed in school, and I am a better football player.”― Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“There are a lot of guys who play in pro-style offenses who are not prepared when they come out of college. Either you’re coaching the quarterback to be a quarterback, or you’re not.”― Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Quotes</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Florence Griffith Joyner Top 18 Quotes</a></h3>Florence Griffith Joyner was a track and field athlete from the United States who was born on December 21, 1959.
