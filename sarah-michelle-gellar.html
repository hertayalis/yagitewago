Movies and TV shows (one in particular that included plenty of <a href=#>fangs</a>) padded her resume, seemingly enough to open the Hollywood floodgates for the beautiful actress. However, Sarah Michelle Gellar hasn’t been seen on screen since the 2016 TV Movie remake of <a href=#>Cruel Intentions</a>, so why haven’t we seen more from Gellar lately?</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>HER RETURN TO SUPERNATURAL TV WILL BE IN THE UPCOMING SERIES, WOLF PACK</strong></h4><p>After eagerly awaiting the icon’s return, fans can rest assured they will once again get to see Sarah Michelle Gellar take on a role in the horror/supernatural TV genre. Late in September, Gellar took to Instagram to share the <a href=#>exciting news</a> that she would be starring in the upcoming Paramount+ series, Wolf Pack. The show will be a spin-off of the Teen Wolf series.</p><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar will play Kristen Ramsey, an arson specialist tasked with capturing arsonists that started a fire that may have set off a supernatural force, turning humans into werewolves.&nbsp;Fans of the queen slayer are hopeful the show will bring Gellar back into the limelight, as even the actress herself noted that she had previously turned down countless similar roles, but felt this one was right in line with Buffy. The first episodes are slated to begin streaming sometime this coming January.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sarah-michelle-gellar-began-acting-at-the-age-four><strong>SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR BEGAN ACTING AT THE AGE FOUR</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MV5BNTFjZTdlNmYtYjgwNC00YWQyLWJiYTctMTU2MmEyOTI1ZTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTMyODM3MTg@._V1_-900x585.jpg><p>The now <a href=#>45-year-old</a> actress got her start early on, appearing in a TV movie (An Invasion of Privacy) at the mere age of four. Sarah Michelle Gellar was also cast in various commercials, one famous one for Burger King where the character she portrayed criticized Mcdonald’s, saying she only will eat at Burger King. McDonald’s, in turn, sued Burger King but also named Gellar in the lawsuit.</p><p>Here’s the infamous commercial…</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>SHE WAS BANNED FROM EATING AT MCDONALDS AFTER APPEARING IN A BURGER KING AD</strong></h4><p>It was once rumored that when the lawsuit completed, Sarah Michelle Gellar was <a href=#>banned</a> from eating at Mcdonald’s. This was in part not true, as she told a British newspaper in 2004, “Banned is a strong word,” she begins, a little defensively. “When I was five I did a commercial for Burger King.”</p><p>It was the first ad in the States to name and shame a rival. “McDonald’s were so outraged, they sued Burger King and named me in the lawsuit. I wasn’t allowed to eat there. It was tough because, when you’re a little kid, McDonald’s is where all your friends have their birthday parties, so I missed out on a lot of apple pies.”</p><p>Her career took a bigger jump in 1993 when Sarah Michelle Gellar landed the part on the daytime soap opera All My Children. She was cast as the long-lost daughter of soap opera queen <a href=#>Susan Lucci</a> (Erica Kane) and it was a role she continued to play off and on until the soap opera went off the air for good in 2011.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-brought-sarah-michelle-gellar-massive-success><strong>BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER BROUGHT SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR MASSIVE SUCCESS</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/buffy2-900x675.jpg><p>Of course, though, Sarah Michelle Gellar made her name on one big TV series: Her starring role as Buffy in Buffy The Vampire Slayer. The show, created by <a href=#>Joss Whedon</a> (Angel, Firefly), lasted seven years and firmly planted Gellar in the spotlight.</p><p>Not only was Buffy a vampire slayer, but she also took on demons and any other monster that she came in contact with. It was a hit series, a fan favorite, and it led to another series, Angel. For the spinoff, she even helped kick off and appeared in a handful of episodes during its five-year run.</p><p>The success of Buffy led Gellar to the big screen. Gellar met her future husband, Freddie Prinze Jr. on the set of I Know What You Did Last Summer in 1997, even though the pair wouldn’t begin dating until 2000. She got a role in Cruel Intentions where she and co-star Selma Blair took home the “<a href=#>Best Kiss</a>” award at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sarahmichellekiss-900x600.jpeg><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar married Prinze in 2002, the year that saw the actors play Fred and Daphne in the movie version of <a href=#>Scooby-Doo</a>. They would reprise those roles two years later in the sequel, Scooby-Doo: Monsters Unleashed. Gellar would also be a part of two more popular horror films: the 2004 movie The Grudge and its sequel, 2006’s The Grudge 2.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sarah-michelle-gellar-is-married-to-freddie-prinze-jr-and-becomes-a-baking-entrepreneur><strong>SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR IS MARRIED TO FREDDIE PRINZE JR AND BECOMES A BAKING ENTREPRENEUR</strong></h4><p>Since that time, Sarah Michelle Gellar has continued to work. She has been choosy with her roles, mainly doing a lot of voice work on shows such as Robot Chicken, <a href=#>Star Wars</a> Rebels, and American Dad.</p><p>She has two children with Prinze, which keeps her busy as a mom. Both Gellar and Prinze decided to focus primarily on voice acting, in order to spend more time at home with their kids. In 2015 Gellar, along with two friends, launched a baking company called <a href=#>Foodstirs</a>.</p><p>Gellar also wrote a cookbook in 2017, Stirring Up Fun With Food. Of her baking company, she told Forbes in a <a href=#>2017 interview</a>, “Being an entrepreneur is like shooting a movie that films 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It’s definitely a constant learning curve.”</p><p>Fear not, Sarah Michelle Gellar had no plans to stop acting any time soon. She continues her voice work on the animated series Masters Of The Universe: Revelation, the reboot of the 1983 animated show He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Gellar will also return to the small screen with the TV series Other People’s Houses, which is based on the novel by <a href=#>Abbi Waxman</a>. Gellar also has a mini-series lined up; Sometimes I Lie.</p><p>Every now and then Gellar still revisits the old days. For instance, she once got one of her old Buffy the Vampire Slayer dresses out of the closet, put it on, and showed it off on Instagram…Here’s what the dress looked like, the first time she wore it on Buffy the Vampire Slayer in 1997 during the season 1 finale…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/buffydress-900x1259.jpeg><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>SHE HAD A TOUGH BATTLE WITH COVID BECAUSE OF HER ASTHMA</strong></h4><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar may have to return to her Buffy days for her next battle. Although she has been properly vaccinated and boosted, the 45-year-old took to Instagram last June to announce that she had tested positive for COVID. But according to her post, turning into Buffy the COVID Slayer is easier said than done.</p><p>She explained that because she has struggled throughout her entire life with asthma and lung issues, battling COVID has not been an easy chore. She even said that on top of being vaccinated and boosted, the therapeutics and protocols she follows have not given her much relief. You can see her announcement below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SMG-COVID.jpg><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR STAYS LOW PROFILE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF VOICE ACTING</strong></h4><p>Apparently, Sarah Michelle Gellar is quite happy with just being a mom to her two children and wife to actor Freddie Prinze Jr. While there has been much talk about the Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot, Gellar has stayed away from most of the talk. In fact, the once red-hot actress, along with her once red-hot actor of a husband, has remained out of the Hollywood limelight, although Prinze Jr. has been quite a bit more active than Gellar.</p><p>After appearing in front of the camera three years ago on The Big Bang Theory, Gellar has remained virtually quiet, except for the occasional voice acting role. She voiced Teela in Kevin Smith’s Masters of the Universe: Revelation which ran for 10 episodes on Netflix. And with the streamer’s recent announcement of a season two <a href=#>titled</a>, Masters of the Universe: Revolution, there is hope that Gellar will be back for the role.</p><p>So far, no casting has been announced but along with Gellar, Mark Hamill voiced Skeletor, Liam Cunningham voiced Duncan, Kevin Michael Richardson voiced Beast Man, Lena Headey voiced Evil-Lyn, and Chris Wood voiced Adam/He-Man. Other than that, Gellar continues to enjoy the home life along with Prinze Jr. Gellar recently posted a picture of the two relaxing and enjoying watching their children as the parents sat on the sidelines.
