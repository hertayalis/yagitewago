I’m so appreciative of Sullivan’s assistance in this matter and the encouraging remarks I see on Julia’s post. I sincerely don’t want to keep any of the funds raised; instead, I would like to offer them to those in need.</p><p>As the listed organizer Nathaniel Sanders of this go fund I would like to thank everyone for their support. This was put together in such haste in response to people wanting to make donations that a lot of information was not added to the story that probably should have been initially.</p><p>The woman that the chair belongs to is Sydney Benes a double amputee that needs the chair to be mobile while she is learning to use her prosthetics. She wanted to remain anonymous during this till she filed a police report for the damages to the chair. That report was filed Wednesday morning and has since made her identity known.</p><p>The bar where this incident happened [sic] is Sullivans Pub in Erie PA. Sullivans is a bar that was built before ADA compliances were enacted and hence grandfathered in and the reason that the restrooms are located at the bottom of the stairs. This is the reason that the chair was parked at the top of the stairs. I personally physically carry her down the stairs any time she has to use the restroom.</p><p>Julia the original poster of the tweet has since gone viral and I am well aware that the $1,500 goal has been reached and exceeded. We have talked to Sydney and she wants to use any money over what it will cost to repair or replace the chair to help others that are in need and in similar situations.</p><p>We do thank everyone for their kindness and generosity with this.</p><p>Soon after the “upsetting” footage went viral, Mercyhurst announced an investigation. The school named Carson Briere as the offender in a later statement.</p><p>Mercyhurst University tweeted on Wednesday afternoon, “We have received a significant outcry regarding the social media video of student Carson Briere showing him pushing an empty wheelchair down a flight of steps. Mr. Briere today released a statement in which he accepted accountability for his actions, acknowledged that his actions demonstrated a “serious lack of judgment,” and expressed his sincere regret. The actions shown in the video break our hearts and fail to live up to Mercy’s belief in the intrinsic dignity of every human being. We offer up prayers and show our support for the sufferer and everyone.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
