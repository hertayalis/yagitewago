Twiggy, with her famous doll-like <a class=hm-link href=#>eyelashes</a>, for one, along with Jean Shrimpton and Dusty Springfield who favoured puffy babydolls and voluminous block fringes.</p><p id=eRS6pK597g4 data-wc=11>Wanting to give your current wardrobe a 1960s-themed overhaul?

Fashion</a><strong>&nbsp;shares the 1960s fashion trends that we still adore today:</strong></p><h2><strong>Mini skirts</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/b461b9015d79-brigitte-bardot-wearing-a-mini-skirt.jpg><p id=eivB0In4-gPu data-wc=57>The modern minthusiast (rolls off the tongue, no?) owes much to the late designer <a class=hm-link href=#>Mary Quant</a>. While she never claimed to be its inventor (that honour she always attributed to the <a class=hm-link href=#>London girls</a> who wore them on the streets), she was one of its greatest champions and named the popular style after her beloved Mini Cooper car.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3oO2CrD4Bbo data-wc=42>As the <a class=hm-link href=#>mini skirt</a> flourished, a shift in the cultural landscape was taking place - women were being allowed more sexual freedom. Its perfection lies in the proportion - with that much flesh on show, there’s a certain threshold of confidence involved.&nbsp;</p><p id=elZHjHnk3f5r data-wc=13><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>80s fashion for women: 6 incredible style moments we still love today</a></strong></p><p id=eKp9xEobEl3F data-wc=9><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>90s fashion trends that are making a comeback</a></strong></p><p id=eV61pXqd0CgT data-wc=41>Stepping out with higher hemlines was a radical move and the girls on the street made a major political statement by channelling such an effortless look. The wearer of the mini is spirited, sexy and most importantly, unaffected by British weather.</p><h3><strong>The party mini</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/148906673028-nensi-dojaka-mini-skirt.jpg><p id=emnTkwMXPH data-wc=42>Oozing disco glam, Nensi Dojaka's silver sequin mini skirt is the ultimate party piece. Cut from tulle, it features cool-girl cut-outs on both hips with heart-shaped detailing. Style yours with a sheer blouse and knee-high boots for a sense of unadulterated glam.</p><p id=e4byNIR-C_1h data-wc=8><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Vintage shopping online: best apps and websites</a></strong></p><h2>Shift silhouette&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/470a2b756113-1960s-trend-shift-dress.jpg><p id=eqUBH445GU data-wc=52>A departure from the hourglass shape that dominated in the 1950s, the shift dress favoured the straight up-and-down look. Flattering on column body types, the shift is defined by fabric that hangs straight down from the shoulders, offering no waist definition. The style was often sleeveless, and coloured with block, poppy hues.</p><h3>The geometric shift</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/04ab79acc1a6-free-people-shift.jpg><p id=eBrTmB5SoYb data-wc=42>Free People's Mira design is playful and cool, nodding to the 1960s both in its straight silhouette and its vibrant geometric pattern. The knitted piece would look cool styled over a voluminous sleeve blouse with glossy Mary Janes for maximum retro vibes.</p><h2>Berets</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/3119b2ea9524-1960s-fashion-beret.jpg><p id=e2Wzc7rqxmFD data-wc=63>A favourite along Beatniks, in the 1960s the beret was often teamed with a black turtleneck and a love of literature. The rise of French New Wave cinema also contributed to its popularity. Styling a beret is not a job for the fainthearted - the slouchy shape has to be carefully positioned on the head so that you don't end up looking ridiculous.&nbsp;</p><h3>The must-have beret</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/6eca8d7ec9ec-brunello-cucinelli-beret.jpg><p id=enoluyhZrB data-wc=53>Crafted in Italy from 100% wool, this pastel blue beret by Bruno Cucinelli is not to everyone's tastes. But for die-hard accessory aficionados, it will come as a welcome wish list addition. With its hand-applied monili beads tip, it would look great alongside a cream polo neck and a dash of rebellious spirit.</p><h2>PVC</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9059b436e61b-1960s-trend-pvc.jpg><p id=eL5fZgsGtd data-wc=57>Designers pushed the boundaries with fabric in the 1960s, and Paco Rabanne was one of those who was ahead of the curve. Incorporating metal and plastic into his ensembles, the designer rejected convention and at around the same time, PVC entered the mix. Glossy finishes not only gave fibres man-made water-repellant properties, the wet-look was hugely fashionable.</p><h3>The statement outerwear</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/f7bf08e45bc8-hvn-coat.jpg><p id=eAhxPIidCz data-wc=54>Coats certainly needn't be boring, and this lime green vinyl piece by HVN is a case in point. Featuring a clear acetate ring at the centre of the belt, the coat is unapologetically loud, and would look great alongside a silk scarf tied at the neck and doll-like lashes. Twiggy would no doubt approve.</p><h2><strong>Crochet</strong></h2><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16a73f6df2dd-crochet-swimsuit-z.jpg></strong><p id=eJv60sUK7Wy5 data-wc=34>Despite its humble origins, this trend is still absolutely everywhere - it's odd to believe that the craft was originally used as a cheap substitute for traditional lace back in early 19th century Europe.</p><p id=ewxiCua9Bsaf data-wc=34>The 1960s saw a huge boom for crochet, and judging by the number of bucket hats, crop tops and slip dresses that are currently on the market today, the trend is going absolutely nowhere. &nbsp;</p><p id=e7Dr3qQw1J data-wc=10><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The 8 best crochet bags to shop right now</a></p><p id=evpdJw5G6s data-wc=16><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why a crochet bucket hat is still the must have accessory to shop this summer</a></p><p id=eCa1Sjfvr5fd data-wc=34>With its design that embraces holes, crochet the perfect technique to wear during the warmer months. A stylish poolside moment would be incomplete without a sleeveless crochet maxi dress layered over a sleek one-piece.</p><h3><strong>The summery mini&nbsp;</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/45c878597873-staud-crochet-dress.jpg><p id=eBCKuW0zFD data-wc=33>Staud's crochet mini hits the 1960s agenda on two key fronts: a shift silhouette and a swirly, psychedelic design. Team with a wide-brim hat and padded flatform sandals for a retro-inspired <a class=hm-link href=#>holiday</a> moment.</p><h2><strong>Psychedelic prints</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/152c4771c77d-raquel-welch-psychedelic-dress.jpg><p id=ed4WT5olprJw data-wc=57>The psychedelic art movement had a major effect on many areas of pop culture, namely music, literature, philosophy and, of course, clothing. The idea is that bright colours, distorted visuals and kaleidoscopic patterns are strongly reminiscent of the experience created by psychedelic substances. Some major artists of the time include Alex Grey, Rick Griffin and Wes Wilson.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOmM5iUXFopt data-wc=50>Plenty of today's fashion brands are still producing collections featuring prints heavily inspired by the movement, including cult brand House of Sunny with its&nbsp;covetable bodycon midi dresses, as well as Emilio Pucci, paying tribute to the brand's founder who was dubbed the 'Prince of Prints' for his esteemed geometrics.</p><h3><strong>The statement maxi&nbsp;</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/46e2ac349f58-natalie-and-alanna-dress.jpg><p id=eh6C-J-Hkj4 data-wc=44>Featuring a jazzy, statement print, this piece by Natalie and Alanna is guaranteed to make an impact. Created from polyester satin, the dress is trimmed with frothy marabou feathers and a plunging keyhole cut-out. Style with big hair, platform heels and a no-nonsense attitude.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Knee-high boots&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f83e3ec57f5e-1960s-actress-ann-margret-wearing-black-boots-z.jpg></strong><p id=er-eeDLqnhMW data-wc=69>Paired with the classic mini skirt, knee-high boots ruled the 1960s footwear scene alongside go-go boots. Heels were not overly high, certainly not in comparison to some of the vertiginous styles we see today, but they still felt cool and chic. Go-gos were white and mid-calf in height, as defined by top designer of the moment, André Courrèges, and made for the perfect accompaniment to a Space Age ensemble.</p><p id=eeFeiIkm2Ueuc data-wc=7><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>We’re obsessed with chunky platforms (again)</a></strong></p><h3><strong>The classic go-gos&nbsp;</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/547cad4ac091-terry-de-havilland-white-boots.jpg><p id=eCKDoL9iPmX data-wc=41>Crafted from quality crocodile effect leather, these Terry de Havilland boots are the retro style seeker's idea of footwear heaven. Style yours with a sheer mini dress and feline flick eyeliner to bring the 60s It-girl look into the 21st century.</p><h2><strong>Tie-dye</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/44dc431db410-jackie-collins-tie-dye.jpg><p id=eqXPufRx9g-_T data-wc=49>This trend was embraced by free-spirited counterculturalists breaking away from the traditional social mould, and it came to symbolise all things peace-related. The idea of clothing as a form of protest gained traction, and many adopted a DIY approach, getting their hands dirty and creating their own tie-dye designs.</p><h3><strong>The shibori midi&nbsp;</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/f959aad46a97-altuzarra-dress.jpg><p id=ei9LsnXL36L data-wc=43>Tie-dye often has a hippyish, rustic feel, but Altuzarra's Philomena dress has an air of chic. Crafted from silk, the piece features flattering waist ties and a plunging neckline and would look great for the evening with minimalist heels and a sleek clutch.</p><h2><strong>Babydoll dresses</strong></h2><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/59f5f1d1f8f4-babydoll-dress-z.jpg></strong><p id=eBfznINAdrA5s data-wc=50>The dress style began its life as a short nightgown, designed by Sylvia Pedlar in 1942 in response to wartime fabric rationing. Versions for children were then created – generally the style is defined by its empire line neckline and flowy skirt which made it easier mothers to change nappies.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejiGirJtA- data-wc=50>The cinematic release of Tennessee Williams' Babydoll, in which actress Carroll Baker wore a short-sleeved frill version, is thought to mark the origin of the dress style's name. In the 1960s, Twiggy paired hers with her now-iconic eye makeup look and T-bar Mary Janes, and thousands of others followed suit.</p><h3>The romantic babydoll</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e2799b05bd58-screenshot-2023-05-12-at-161507.jpg><p id=ekSOeXsHXpy data-wc=42>With ruffle-lined seams, this saccharine pink mini by Sister Jane has a playful girlishness about it. Created from organza jacquard, the tiered shape is reminiscent of an antique fairy doll. Team with a padded headband and metallic platforms for an outdoor soirée.</p><p id=esV0DpiKBe3iV data-wc=21><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
