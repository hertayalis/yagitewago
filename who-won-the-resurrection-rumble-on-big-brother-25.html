And after three hard-fought rounds, one of them earned the right to make a big decision on Thursday night’s live show.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>September 21 spelled the end for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Hardin</a> and Jared Fields’ time on the show — or so we and the houseguests thought. After the season’s first double eviction wrapped, host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Chen Moonves</a> informed the two ousted competitors that their games weren’t dead; they were undead.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Donning zombie attire, Cameron and Jared re-entered the house with the mission of winning the battle-back competition in a week. The victor will join Jagateshwar “Jag” Bains as the second player to avoid going home after being voted out this season.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>The loser will join Julie outside the house once again. And considering Big Brother 25 only has a seven-person jury, the defeated zombie will be sent packing.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Two stages were introduced to determine who’ll make their Big Brother comeback. First, the Resurrection Rumble was a series with three challenges. Fans who caught Sunday’s episode watched Cameron and Jared duel in two matches, and after the dust settled, Cameron was up 13 points to Jared’s nine.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Although round three has played out, the September 24 episode cut the result, building more anticipation for Thursday’s episode. But, we know from following the live feeds that Cameron ultimately came out on top with the most points.</p><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>But just because Cameron won the Ressurection Rumble doesn’t mean he’s back in the game. The three-part series was used to determine who’d play in the final competition on Thursday. Since Cameron was victorious, he’ll have the opportunity to choose if he or Jared plays in the live game. If the player succeeds in the solo competition, they’ll remain in the house and their game will restart. But, if they lose, they’ll be given their walking papers.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Since only one of them is returning, whoever doesn’t play in the comp will have to watch from the sidelines as their opponent decides their fate. Cameron has made it clear that he intends to take his game into his own hands on Thursday by competing in the final zombie quest.</p><h2 id=h-cameron-went-out-on-jared-s-head-of-household-then-jared-followed-cameron-out-the-door data-injectable=false>Cameron went out on Jared’s Head of Household, then Jared followed Cameron out the door</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Well, whoever returns will likely have a big target on their back. Cameron was at the top of several houseguests’ hit lists for weeks. But, after saving himself with two Head of Households and a Power of Veto, Cameron’s third trip to the nomination block led to his unanimous eviction on day 51.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>Then, Jared — the Head of Household charged with nominating Cameron — followed him out the door less than an hour later. Heading into the double eviction, it was apparent Jared was public enemy No. 1 after his social and strategic wheelings and dealings had been exposed. Cory Wurtenberger snagged the Head of Household key, and Jared found himself up for eviction alongside his showmance, Blue Kim.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>Matt Klotz then won the Power of Veto, sealing Jared’s fate. Cory’s nominations remained the same and Jared was sent out the front door with a 6-1 vote.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>It’s unclear if Cameron or Jared can find their footing in the house. But, they’re trying. And one of them will resurrect their games later this week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrqimXam1pnnRnqquqqKasLW1zqdkq62dl7mmec6nZJuhl2Kvs7vToZyrZWJqfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brandon-hammond-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brandon Hammond Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jenna-renee-webb-her-bio-family-other-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jenna Renee Webb?Her Biography, Family &amp;amp; Other Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./76147-alan-jacksons-cute-daughters-grown-beaut-html.html>Alan Jackson's three cute little daughters are all grown up now and look like beautiful models</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./could-the-terminal-list-get-a-season-2.html>Could The Terminal List get a season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-hyperx-alloy-elite-rgb-mechanical-keyboard-review.html>Per-Key Quality Testing &amp;amp; Hands-On</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-banlaki-net-worth.html>Rbert Bnlaki Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caught-on-cam-srikanths-son-with-shanaya-kapoor.html>Srikanth's Son with Shanaya Kapoor</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt.
