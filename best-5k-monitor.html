The ultrawide (21:9 aspect ratio) nature of the monitor allows for stacking up to three windows easily while the 2500R curvature should eliminate any off-axis color shift.</p><p>With a focus on delivering maximum productivity at your workplace, the monitor is suitable for creative professionals as it comes with a color-accurate 10-bit panel that is rated for 100% sRGB, 98% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage, and a Delta E &lt;2.</p><p>The monitor is pretty loaded on the connectivity front, including a DisplayPort 1.4, two HDMI 2.0 ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, a host of USB ports with power delivery options, an RJ45 Ethernet jack, and a 3.5mm jack for audio. The monitor also comes with integrated dual nine-watt speakers, low-blue light emission, MAC address pass-through, Wake-on-LAN, and various preset color modes, as well as Picture-in-Picture (PIP) and Picture-by-Picture (PBP) modes. Additionally, the monitor comes with a KVM switch that allows controlling more than one PC using a single keyboard and mouse.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2022/6/17/a9f0e46dc0de721e41be823382fa2872ba5d3ef7.jpeg alt="Dell UltraSharp U4021QW" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Dell UltraSharp U4021QW Best 5K monitor with built-in USB hub <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-nhJCdJxwMz class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=nhJCdJxwMz>LG UltraWide 40WP95C-W</h2><h3>Best ultrawide 5K monitor</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Excellent color coverage</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Support for HDR10</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Thunderbolt 4 connectivity</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>72Hz refresh rate with FreeSync</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Daisy chain capable</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Low brightness in HDR</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Weak contrast levels</li></ul><p><strong>Why you should buy this:</strong> One of the best 5K ultrawide monitors suitable for a variety of users.</p><p><strong>Who's it for:</strong> Those who need a 5K monitor with multiple-use cases, including content creation, multitasking, and even some gaming at high resolutions.</p><p><strong>Why we chose the LG UltraWide 40WP95C-W:</strong></p><p>The LG UltraWide 40WP95C-W might seem similar to the Dell UltraSharp U4021QW, but overall it is a better monitor. It supports HDR (which the Dell does not), a higher refresh rate (72Hz vs. 60Hz), and support for Thunderbolt 4 for faster bandwidth. It is also currently selling at a comparatively cheaper price.</p><p>The monitor is an excellent choice for media creation thanks to its high-resolution and wide color gamut coverage, while the large size is great for office productivity. It uses a Nano IPS panel with a 5120x2160 pixels resolution, 98% coverage of the DCI-P3 spectrum for accurate color, and it is hardware calibration-ready in case you want to tinker with the settings. As mentioned before, there is support for HDR10 and while it should look good, you do need to consider that there are no local dimming zones, so it isn't extremely bright and the contrast levels are low.</p><p>The LG UltraWide 40WP95C-W can also be used for gaming. It comes with <a href=#>AMD FreeSync</a>, up to 5ms (GtG) response time, and while the 72Hz refresh isn't comparable to most gaming monitors it's still 20% faster than your average 60Hz display. The sheer resolution makes it perfect for games that focus on visual elements rather than fast-paced action, too.</p><p>Other notable features include built-in 10-watt speakers, Dynamic Action Sync to reduce input lag, auto-brightness with ambient light sensor, low blue light filter mode, and support for daisy-chaining multiple monitors at 5K resolution. Connectivity options include two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a DisplayPort, two HDMI ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, and two USB 3.0 Type-A ports.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2022/6/17/9345e1709145140021803b08a5233d8b99bb74df.jpeg alt="LG UltraWide 40WP95C-W" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> LG UltraWide 40WP95C-W Best ultrawide 5K monitor <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-mhz0xjGgJy class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=mhz0xjGgJy>Apple Studio Display</h2><h3>Best display for Mac ecosystem</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>High pixel density</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Wide viewing angles</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Color accurate panel</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Great speakers and microphone</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>No HDR support</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Expensive</li></ul><p><strong>Why you should buy this:</strong> The most premium 27-inch monitor with 5K resolution.</p><p><strong>Who's it for:</strong> For those who swear by the Apple ecosystem, especially the ones who need a high-resolution display for content creation.</p><p><strong>Why we chose the Apple Studio Display:</strong></p><p>Apple's Studio Display is the company's second-ever external display meant for creative professionals and a more affordable option <a href=#>compared to the Pro Display XDR</a>.

The speakers also offer Dolby Atmos virtual spatial audio making the Studio Display the best monitor with built-in speakers. There is also a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera paired with three microphones with noise-canceling so you can easily make video calls. The camera supports Apple Center Stage, which can automatically track and place you in the center of the frame. As for connectivity, the Studio Display comes with a Thunderbolt 3 upstream port that supports up to 96 watts of power for charging and three downstream USB-C ports.</p><p>Considering the feature set, the Apple Studio Display doesn't sound as worthy as the Pro Display XDR, especially since LG's Ultrafine 27MD5KL-B offers similar features at a more affordable price, but it's still healthy competition in a space that doesn't have a wealth of options.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2022/3/11/89f1cb4d759d9b6345ff1883580d5e04b0194f6c.jpeg alt="Apple Studio Display" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Apple Studio Display Best display for Mac ecosystem <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-yCO1XLmgka class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=yCO1XLmgka>Samsung ViewFinity S9</h2><h3>Most feature packed 5K monitor</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Solid alternative to the Apple Studio Display</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Great viewing angles</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Detachable 4K camera</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Wireless connectivity options</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Built-in smart features</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>No power button on the display</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>External power adapter</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Build quality could be better</li></ul><p><strong>Why you should buy this:</strong> A solid competitor to the Apple Studio Display packing excellent features.</p><p><strong>Who's it for:</strong> Anyone who is looking for premium 5K monitor with wide connectivity and smart features.</p><p><strong>Why we chose the Samsung ViewFinity S9:</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>ViewFinity S9</a> is Samsung's answer to the Apple Studio Display.

This calibration process adds to the cost.</li><li>Large Screen sizes: Many 5K monitors come in larger screen sizes, which require more materials and are more costly to produce.</li><li>Additional features: High-end 5K monitors often come with extra features like USB-C connectivity, multiple input options, adjustable stands, and advanced image processing capabilities, further increasing the cost.</li><li>Limited market: 5K monitors are not as common as lower-resolution displays (such as 4K or 1080p), which means that they may have a smaller market share. This limited demand can drive prices up due to economies of scale.</li><li>Research and development: The development of higher-resolution monitors, especially with advanced features, requires research and development investments that are reflected in the final product's cost.</li><li>Brand and build quality: Well-known and reputable brands tend to charge a premium for their monitors, reflecting not only the quality of the product but also the assurance of after-sales support and warranty coverage.</li><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfmLyuvNStoKefX5eytMCMbqJmpZ%2BjtrW70Wg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-sophie-turners-net-worth-biography-net-worth-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Sophie Turners Net Worth: Biography, Net Worth &amp;amp; more</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./120mm-radiator-fan-roundup-part-2-fan-harder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Fans We're Testing, Part 3</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./76147-alan-jacksons-cute-daughters-grown-beaut-html.html>Alan Jackson's three cute little daughters are all grown up now and look like beautiful models</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./could-the-terminal-list-get-a-season-2.html>Could The Terminal List get a season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-hyperx-alloy-elite-rgb-mechanical-keyboard-review.html>Per-Key Quality Testing &amp;amp; Hands-On</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./robert-banlaki-net-worth.html>Rbert Bnlaki Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caught-on-cam-srikanths-son-with-shanaya-kapoor.html>Srikanth's Son with Shanaya Kapoor</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt.
