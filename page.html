If you aren’t familiar with smørrebrød, they are open faced sandwiches with artfully-piled toppings on dense, rectangle-shaped rye bread. It’s the national dish of Denmark… that I’m about to make a completely non-traditional version of – but this is super yummy, so let’s just have fun and go with it! 🙂 Smørrebrød toppings vary widely, but many common combinations include smoked salmon and dill.

It’s bright and briny, creamy and tangy, and every bit as good as the real thing. Tofu steps in for the eggs, so it’s packed with enough plant-based protein to keep you full till dinner. And because you don’t need to have hard boiled eggs on hand to make it, it comes together in no time. Mix it up, pile it between slices of bread with your favorite fresh fixings, and dig in!

My new cookbook, Love & Lemons Every Day, is out TODAY!! I’m so excited to be sitting here writing this post, because the process of making this book was a long one! About 3 years ago, I set out with SO many ideas that I wanted to pack into this book. Over time, I kept adding more and more… and more. I’d think – “Ooh, this section would be helpful,” or “Oh I’d like to have that information on hand,”&nbsp;and “Let’s add MORE dinner recipes,” etc, etc. As I got carried away, the process got longer, the book…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>It’s starting to feel like spring! Well, actually, it’s still 30 degrees here, but it’s at least starting to look like spring out there. The sun is shining and the days are getting longer.

If you’re new to matcha – it’s a powder made from Japanese green tea leaves. Because the whole leaf is ground (vs. steeping the tea leaves), matcha is packed with antioxidants.

Instead of offering a menu, it serves one rotating meal that always contains a grain, a legume, blanched greens, steamed vegetables, a pickled vegetable, and a delicious sauce. It may sound limiting, but I’ve honestly had some of the best sauce and vegetable pairings of my life there. If you’re ever in Austin, make sure you check it out!
