It is sad to see how gun violence is eating America, and its innocent citizens and lawmakers are doing nothing to stop such incidents.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Kaylin Gillis GoFundMe" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kaylin-Gillis-GoFundMe.webp alt="Kaylin Gillis GoFundMe" width=500 height=296 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On April 13, 2023, we witnessed the Killing of Kaylin Gillis; we were discussing the Shooting of <a href=# rel=noopener>Ralph Yarl</a>, where a 16-year-old was targeted by 84-year-old<a href=# rel=noopener> Andrew Lester</a> for ringing the wrong doorbell, and just three days later, Kaylin got murdered for same kind of mistake.</p><p>A fundraising campaign was started by Beth Palleschi and Nikki Thomas on GoFundMe with the target to raise $125,000 to help manage funeral expenses and any other financial needs. Anybody who wants to help the Gillis family in this time of need can contribute.</p><p>Is there any value in human life in America? If yes, then how are these incidents happening every single day, and no action is being taken? It is high time; people must unite if they want their kids to feel and stay safe.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Kaylin Gillis Facebook" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kaylin-Gillis-Facebook.webp alt="Kaylin Gillis Facebook" width=450 height=365 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>What Happened to Kaylin Gillis?</strong></h2><p>The evening of April 16, 2023, took a tragic turn for Kaylin Gillis and her friends when they were driving in Hebron, New York, looking for a friend’s house.</p><p>Little did they know that a wrong turn would lead to a life-altering event. As they attempted to back the car out of the driveway they mistakenly entered, the homeowner, Kevin D. Monahan, came out of his house and fired several rounds at the vehicle.</p><p>Somehow Kaylin and her friends got away and reached the neighboring town of Salem in search of emergency services. Despite their efforts to seek medical help, the wounds sustained by the young girl were too severe, and she tragically lost her life.</p><p>The incident has since been the subject of much media attention, with Monahan’s attorney trying to justify the shooting as an “act of self-defense.” The lawyer argues that there was an element of fear on Mr. Monagan’s part that caused him to act in such a manner.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Kaylin Gillis childhood photo with her father Andrew and mother Angelique Gillis" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kaylin-Gillis-childhood-photo-with-her-father-Andrew-and-mother-Angelique-Gillis.webp alt="Kaylin Gillis childhood photo with her father Andrew and mother Angelique Gillis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Kaylin Gillis’ Parents</strong></h2><p>On <strong>February 23, 2003</strong>, Kaylin A.
