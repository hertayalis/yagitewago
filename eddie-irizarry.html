Irizarry (age: 27, 1996 – August 14, 2023) was a Puerto Rico resident&nbsp;who was murdered in the streets of Philadelphia by <a href=# rel=noopener>Mark Dial</a>, an officer of the Philadelphia Police Department.</p><p>The incident occurred on August 14 during a routine traffic stop when Officer Mark Dial, a member of the Philadelphia Police Department, was involved.</p><p>Eddie’s family firmly believed in his innocence, prompting them to call for the release of the bodycam footage to shed light on the circumstances surrounding his death.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the Police Department asserted that Eddie had suddenly moved toward the officers, leading Mark Dial to use deadly force.</p><p>However, before the release of the video footage, there were claims that Eddie had been inside his vehicle at the time of the incident. Upon viewing the bodycam footage, District Attorney Larry Krasner and Eddie’s family decided to advocate for its public release.</p><p>The unaltered video depicts Officer Mark Dial discharging his weapon into Irizarry’s vehicle through the closed driver’s side window five seconds after exiting his patrol car.</p><p>A GoFundMe campaign was set up to raise money for Eddie’s grieving family. After collecting $7370, the family stopped accepting donations. The Puerto Rican family spent the ordered amount to bear funeral and memorial expenses.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Eddie Irizarry Obituary" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Eddie-Irizarry-Obituary.webp alt="Eddie Irizarry Obituary" width=400 height=580 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Bodycam Footage Show Eddie was Innocent</strong></h2><p>Initially, the police asserted that Mr. Irizarry had aggressively approached them outside his vehicle, brandishing a knife. However, the release of body camera footage by Philadelphia prosecutors on Friday unequivocally demonstrated that Mr. Irizarry was indeed seated in the driver’s seat of his vehicle when the officer opened fire.</p><p>This revelation has led to questions about how the initial false account of the incident came to be. In contrast, Dial’s attorney has maintained that his client resorted to using force because he believed he had witnessed Mr. Irizarry holding a firearm.</p><p>However, prosecutors have countered this claim by asserting that Mr. Irizarry was merely in possession of a minor, open folding knife, held against his thigh, with his car window rolled up at the time of the incident.</p><p>The sequence of events began when Mr. Irizarry parked his Toyota Corolla on a street in Kensington, a neighborhood in Philadelphia. Police had reportedly stopped him for making an incorrect turn on the road.</p><p>Dial and his partner approached Mr. Irizarry in a police vehicle, and in the video, an officer can be heard instructing the young man to display his hands. Shockingly, five seconds later, the officer discharged multiple shots at Mr. Irizarry, who remained seated in the driver’s seat throughout the encounter.</p><p>The video footage further reveals that the two officers extracted an unresponsive Mr. Irizarry from his car and placed him in the backseat of a marked police vehicle, subsequently transporting him to the hospital.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Eddie Irizarry height" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Eddie-Irizarry-height.webp alt="Eddie Irizarry height" width=400 height=659 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Police Union Supporting Dial</strong></h2><p>Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, in a released statement, appealed to the public to maintain peacefulness in their demonstrations and calls for accountability. He also emphasized the importance of patience while a comprehensive and meticulous investigation unfolds.</p><p>Mayor Kenney expressed his heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of Eddie Irizarry, acknowledging the profound grief they are enduring.</p><p>He admitted that no measure the city takes can bring Eddie back. Still, he expressed his confidence in the District Attorney’s Office as they work diligently to seek justice for Mr. Irizarry and his family.</p><p>Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw reiterated the police department’s unwavering commitment to the safety and well-being of the communities they serve.</p><p>She emphasized their dedication to conducting the administrative investigation with integrity, ensuring fairness, equity, and transparency.</p><p>The Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, representing rank-and-file officers, issued a statement expressing their unwavering support for Officer Mark Dial.</p><p>They urged the public to withhold judgment until all the evidence is presented during the trial, underscoring the importance of a fair and impartial legal process.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Eddie Irizarry father Eddie Irizarry Sr and sister Maria Irizarry" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Eddie-Irizarry-father-Eddie-Irizarry-Sr-and-sister-Maria-Irizarry.webp alt="Eddie Irizarry father Eddie Irizarry Sr and sister Maria Irizarry" width=378 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Eddie Irizarry Came to America in 2016</strong></h2><p>In 1996, Eddie Irizarry (27) was born in Puerto Rico.
